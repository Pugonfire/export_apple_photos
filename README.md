# export_apple_photos
Giving exported Apple Photos (Mac) a structured file name for archiving 

# The Issue
Backing up Apple's Photos Library is suboptimal. At the moment, the only way to back up the library is to back a "Photos Library.photoslibrary" file which can only be run by another Mac OS enabled device. Other windows or linux devices are unable to access the photos library 

# The Dream

Filename: "IMG-0052" ----> "<date> <keywords> <faces> <location> <camera>"

For example:

"IMG-0052" ----> "220269_albumcoverart_john_paul_george_ringo_abbeyroad_NikonF2"
