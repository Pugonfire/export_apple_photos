# rename_apple_photos
Giving exported Apple Photos (Mac) a structured file name for archiving 

# The Issue
Backing up Apple's Photos Library is suboptimal. At the moment, the only way to back up the library is to back a "Photos Library.photoslibrary" file which can only be run by another Mac OS enabled device. Other windows or linux devices are unable to access the photos library 

# The Dream

To rename photos with useful filenames 

Filename: "IMG0052" ----> **"[date] [keywords] [faces] [location] [camera] [Filename]"**

For example:

![Abbey Road](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/42/Beatles_-_Abbey_Road.jpg)

"IMG0052" ----> **"220269_albumcoverart_john_paul_george_ringo_abbeyroad_NikonF2_IMG0052"**
